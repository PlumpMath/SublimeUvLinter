Fast linter for Sublime Text 3 relying on the pipe streaming ability
of pyuv/libuv.

Currently, it supports only Python linting via flake8 but contributions
are welcome!

- [flake8](https://bitbucket.org/tarek/flake8)
- [flake8-immediate](https://github.com/schlamar/flake8-immediate)
- Make sure that `flake8` is under your PATH in Sublime Text.
